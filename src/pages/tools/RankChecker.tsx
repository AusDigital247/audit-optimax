          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">Strategies to Improve Your Search Rankings</h2>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Technical SEO Optimization</h3>
          <p>
            Ensure your website has a solid technical foundation. Focus on site speed, mobile responsiveness, proper indexing, and structured data implementation. A technically sound website creates a better user experience and makes it easier for search engines to crawl and index your content.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Content Quality and Relevance</h3>
          <p>
            Create comprehensive, authoritative content that addresses user intent. Use primary and LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) keywords naturally throughout your content. Focus on solving problems and providing valuable information rather than keyword stuffing.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Backlink Building</h3>
          <p>
            Develop a strategy to earn high-quality backlinks from authoritative websites in your industry. Focus on creating linkable assets, building relationships with influencers, and guest posting on relevant sites to improve your domain authority.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">User Experience Optimization</h3>
          <p>
            Improve on-site metrics like bounce rate, time on page, and pages per session by enhancing user experience. Implement clear navigation, optimize page layout, and ensure content is easy to read and engage with across all devices.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Regular Content Updates</h3>
          <p>
            Keep your content fresh and updated with the latest information. Regularly review and improve existing pages, especially those ranking on page two or at the bottom of page one, to signal to search engines that your content is current and authoritative.
          </p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">How often should I check my search rankings?</h3>
          <p>
            For most websites, checking rankings once a week is sufficient to track progress while accounting for normal fluctuations. If you've made significant changes to your site or content, you might want to check more frequently to monitor the impact.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Why do my rankings fluctuate day to day?</h3>
          <p>
            Search rankings naturally fluctuate due to algorithm updates, changes in user behavior, competitor activities, and technical factors like server location and personalization. Focus on long-term trends rather than daily changes.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Are ranking positions the same for everyone?</h3>
          <p>
            No, search results can vary based on location, search history, device type, and personalization factors. Our rank checker tool provides standardized results that represent average positions across users.
