          A Creator's Secret Weapon
        </h2>
        <div className="text-navy-light dark:text-white/90 mb-8">
          <p>After spending years helping creators grow their TikTok accounts, I've seen firsthand how the right hashtags can make or break your visibility. Back in 2021, I was working with a dance studio that couldn't seem to get past 300 views per video. Their content was fantastic—but no one was seeing it!</p>
          <p className="mt-4">Have you ever felt like you're shouting into the void on TikTok? That's exactly how my clients felt. We experimented with different hashtag strategies for two weeks, and I was genuinely surprised by the results. By replacing generic tags like #dance with more specific, trending ones like #dancechallenge2023, their views jumped to 5,000+ per video.</p>
          <p className="mt-4">The TikTok algorithm is notoriously fickle, isn't it? One day you're riding high on views, the next you're wondering if your account is shadowbanned. Through trial and error with dozens of accounts, I've learned that hashtag strategy isn't just about volume—it's about finding that sweet spot between trending, relevant, and niche.</p>
          <p className="mt-4">This tool combines what I've learned from years of TikTok optimization, helping you cut through the guesswork. Rather than copying what everyone else is doing, you'll get hashtags that actually align with how the algorithm categorizes your specific type of content.</p>

          Real Results from Real Creators
        </h2>
        <div className="text-navy-light dark:text-white/90 mb-8">
          <p>Just last month, I was consulting with a food blogger who was struggling to break into the FoodTok community. Despite creating mouth-watering recipe videos, her content was getting buried. We completely revamped her hashtag strategy using this exact approach.</p>
          <p className="mt-4">Instead of general tags like #food and #recipes, we targeted specific hashtags like #comfortfoodhacks and #10minutemeals that had high engagement but lower competition. Within two weeks, one of her videos hit over 200K views—her first viral moment after months of posting!</p>
          <p className="mt-4">What I find fascinating is how different hashtag combinations work for different content styles. A beauty tutorial needs a completely different strategy than a comedy skit or product review. Through managing multiple creator accounts, I've built a mental database of what works across different TikTok niches.</p>
          <p className="mt-4">The most common mistake I see? Using the same hashtags on every single post. The algorithm actually values variety, and I've seen accounts get significantly less reach when they fall into this pattern.</p>

          Why TikTok Hashtags Matter More Than Ever
        </h2>
        <div className="text-navy-light dark:text-white/90 mb-8">
          <p>
            In my 7+ years working with social media algorithms, I've watched TikTok evolve dramatically. Early on, simply posting consistently was enough to grow. Now, with millions of creators competing for attention, strategic hashtag use has become essential for discovery.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            I recently analyzed 500+ TikTok videos from rising creators and found something surprising: videos with 5-7 carefully chosen hashtags consistently outperformed those with more or fewer tags. It's not about quantity—it's about relevance and strategic selection.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            The most successful creators I've worked with don't just throw popular hashtags on every post. They research, test, and refine their approach based on actual performance data. That's exactly what this tool helps you do—find the right hashtags for your specific content, not just generic popular tags everyone else is using.
